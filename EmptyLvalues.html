      <h1>Assignment categories of glvalues</h1>
      This paper proposes to introduce, amongst other things, the notion of an empty lvalue as discussed 
      in core issue 232.<sup><a href="#CWG232">CWG232</a></sup> 
      The wording is partly adapted from the proposed wording in that core issue
      and core issue 453.<sup><a href="#CWG453">CWG453</a><br>
      <br>
      </sup> This proposal resolves both these core issues and core issue 504.<sup><a href="#CWG504">CWG504</a></sup>
      <h2>Motivation and proposed resolutions</h2>
      <p>The standard is unclear about its treatment of indirection through
         null pointers and pointers past the end of an object; <tt>typeid</tt>
         is specified to treat lvalues created by dereferencing a null pointer,
         and the common idiom <tt>&amp;arr[len]</tt> is currently undefined.
         The standard is also unclear about its distinction of lvalues referring
         to objects and merely storage. This proposal introduces rigorous classifications 
         of references and expressions and employs them to define these expressions flawlessly. 
      </p>
      
      <p>As of the rework on value categories, non-<tt>void</tt> expressions are put into two classes: glvalues and prvalues. Prvalues are said to have a value; 
      and glvalues' &ldquo;evaluation determines the identity of an object, bitfield or function&rdquo;. However, while prvalues indeed always designate values, 
      glvalues do not necessarily evaluate to any member of that list. They can be invalid, or refer to memory locations that don't hold objects of the specified type. Some wording makes
      silent assumptions about what glvalues refer to, which can make reasoning about the well-formedness difficult; then again,
      other wording is straight out inconsistent. </p>
      
      <h3>Assignment categories of expressions</h3>
      &hellip;solve this issue by classifying the different states of a glvalue. More specifically, a glvalue can be
      <ul>
		  <li>assigned to <ul>
			  <li>an object,</li>
			  <li>a function, or</li>
			  <li>allocated storage, or</li>
		  </ul></li>
		  <li>past the end of an object&mdash;i.e. refer to the hypothetical past-the-end object of an array &mdash;, or</li>
		  <li>null (this corresponds to what earlier papers called an &ldquo;empty lvalue&rdquo;), or</li>
		  <li>invalid.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This covers all different possible states of a glvalue. Certain uses of unassigned lvalues are now defined, in particular
            Lvalue Transformations and the unary <tt>&amp;</tt> operator.</p>
      
      <h3>References</h3>
      <p>Finally, in conjunction with the rework on reference intialization and state, we propose that a reference shall not be
            initialized with its own name. This makes code ill-formed with a
            diagnostic required - note that all common implementations already
            diagnose this as a warning. For further discussion on this topic, see
            also SG12's mailing list.<sup><a href="#UB504">UB504</a></sup></p>
      
      
      <h2>Proposed wording</h2>
      This wording is relative to N4640.

side of an assignment (although this is no longer generally true); glvalues are &ldquo;generalized&rdquo; lvalues, prvalues

                  there can't be any glvalues referring to the memory occupied by a

                  ill-formed, and accessing a member of an object that isn't alive is
                  undefined. That is, any glvalue referring to a bit-field is an assigned

            An <em>invalid</em> expression is one that referred to an object or

         The assignment category (3.10 [basic.lval]) of a reference's name is called the reference's assignment category:

         As described above, if a reference is initialized to be an invalid reference, the

         the expression it was directly bound to. [<em>Note</em>: a reference's assignment category
