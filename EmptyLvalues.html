<h2>Fine grained expression classification and reference semantics</h2>

This paper proposes to introduce the notion of an empty lvalue as
discussed in core issue 232.<sup><a href="#CWG232">CWG232</a></sup> The
wording is partly adapted from the proposed wording in that core issue
and
core issue 453.<sup><a href="#CWG453">CWG453</a><br>


<br>
</sup> This proposal resolves both these core issues and core issue 504.<sup><a href="#CWG504">CWG504</a></sup>
<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>The standard is unclear about its treatment of indirection through
null pointers and pointers past the end of an object. <tt>typeid</tt>
is specified to treat lvalues created by dereferencing a null pointer,
and the common idiom <tt>&amp;arr[len]</tt> is currently undefined.
The standard is also unclear about its distinction of lvalues referring
to objects and merely storage.<br>
<br>

</p>


<h3>Proposed changes</h3>

We propose four major changes that do not affect the semantics of any
program:<br>

<ol>
<li>A glvalue can be <span style="font-style: italic;">assigned</span>,
    <span style="font-style: italic;">null</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">invalid</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">past the end of</span> an object, exactly
like pointer values (as formalized in P0137).<br>


  </li><li>Certain uses of unassigned lvalues are now defined, in particular
Lvalue Transformations and the unary <tt>&amp;</tt> operator.</li><li> A reference shall not be
initialized with its own name. This makes code ill-formed with a
diagnostic required - note that all common implementations already
diagnose this as a warning. For further discussion on this topic, see
also SG12's mailing list.<sup><a href="#UB504">UB504</a></sup><br>
  </li><li>References have a subset of glvalues' assignment categories: <span style="font-style: italic;">Assigned object/function/storage reference</span>,
or <span style="font-style: italic;">invalid reference</span>.</li>
</ol>

These classifications allow for much more rigorous arguing about
programs' well-definedness. <br>


<h3>Proposed wording</h3>

This wording is relative to N4567 and P0137R0.<sup><a href="#P0137R0">P0137R0</a></sup>

calling a function whose return type is an rvalue reference to an
object type is an xvalue (5.2.2). &#8212; <em>end example</em> ] <ins>[<em>Note:</em>


an xvalue cannot be null or past the end of an object, because
the only way to obtain such an xvalue would bind an unassigned lvalue
to a
reference via
a cast, which has undefined behavior (8.3.2 [dcl.ref]). &#8212; <em>end note</em>]</ins>
    </li><li>A <em>glvalue</em>

[ <em>Example</em>: The result of calling a function whose return type

    <li>an allocated region of storage (possibly occupied by an object), in which case it is an <em>assigned

there can't be any glvalues referring to the memory occupied by a

object glvalue. &#8212; <em>end note</em>]<br></li>

An <em>invalid</em> expression is one that referred to an object or

one of the classifications listed above:
null expression (lvalues only), expression past the end of an object
